    paragraphs: [
      "It is important to ensure that the correct quantity of cargo has been loaded onto a vessel. Disputes can arise at the load or discharge port between the vessel owner and charterer, or the vessel and the shipper/receiver of the cargo.",
      "For that purpose, it is important to have a marine surveyor verify the amount of cargo loaded or discharged by Draft Survey. Our team has vast experience in conducting draft surveys at various ports in Australia."

    title: "On / Off Hire Survey",
    image: imageURLs[1],
    paragraphs: [
      "It is very important to determine the general condition of the vessel when the vessel’s owner hires the vessel out to a charterer. It is equally important for the charterer to know exactly what is being hired.",
      "This calls for an On-Hire Condition and Bunker Survey. Our surveyors perform a detailed survey of the general condition of the vessel and cargo holds and quantify the bunkers on board during the hiring or the de-hiring process."

    title: "Cargo Hold Cleanliness Inspection",
    image: imageURLs[2],
    paragraphs: [
      "Australia exports a variety of bulk cargoes, for which the cargo holds require a rather clean condition. Potential contaminants such as rust or previous cargo residues are not tolerated. Once the vessel fails the cargo hold inspection, the expense of cleaning the cargo holds is astronomical, especially if a shore-based crew is engaged.",
      "Cargo Care surveyors can inspect the vessel's cargo holds prior to inspection by the shipper’s surveyor and advise the Master/owner on what cleaning to carry out. In our experience, this has worked out very economical for our existing clients in the past."

    title: "Cargo Holds Water-tightness Test / Sealing",
    image: imageURLs[3],
    paragraphs: [
      "At times, it is required by charterers that vessel’s cargo holds be tested for water-tightness prior to loading cargo. This could be for insurance purposes. It may further be required that hatch covers and hatch entrances be sealed with numbered security seals after loading is complete.",
      "Cargo Care can assist with both the above by performing a hose test or chalk test on the hatch covers and entrances. Hatch entrances and hatch covers are also sealed by our surveyors after completion of loading."

    title: "Preparatory Port State Control Inspection",
    image: imageURLs[4],
    paragraphs: [
      "On a regular basis, surveyors from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority board vessels in Australian ports and conduct a Port State Control Inspection. This is a safety inspection and serious deficiencies can be found; the vessel can be detained.",
      "To prevent that from happening, our surveyors board the vessel prior to the PSC surveyor and conduct a preparatory inspection. Any deficiencies found are promptly rectified by the ship’s crew."

    title: "Container / Cargo Damage Surveys",
    image: imageURLs[5],
    paragraphs: [
      "Sometimes cargo within a container is noted to be damaged when the container is opened by the receiver. Cargo Care can be instrumental in protecting the receiver’s interests or the shipping line’s interest in that event.",
      "A detailed report with photos is issued after the inspection and ways of mitigation of claims are suggested."

    title: "Container / Flatrack Lashing Surveys",
    image: imageURLs[6],
    paragraphs: [
      "Most shipping companies require a marine surveyor to report that the lashings taken by the exporter are adequate for the intended voyage. Cargo Care has for some time now been engaged in the inspection of stowage and lashing of cargo on a flatrack, or cargo within a container.",
      "A report is issued with photos and description of the securing. Also, Out of Gauge measurements are reported if applicable."

    paragraphs: [
      "Surveyors from Cargo Care can attend your vessel from arrival to departure at certain Australian ports and assist the Master with various aspects of cargo operations, liaising with various parties such as Port Authority, Cargo Interests, Shipping Agents, etc. This provides the vessel’s owner or charterer with complete peace of mind, knowing that the vessel is in good hands."

    paragraphs: [
      "Cargo Care has also carried out several surveys for P & I Clubs such as establishing the extent of damage and cause of a collapsed stow, possible involvement of a vessel in an oil spillage, etc. We also carry out Ship Condition Inspections for P & I Clubs."
